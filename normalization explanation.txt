Table Normalization Explanation

Work Activities Table 

This is the main table in the database. It includes onet_code and position_id
which show up in other tables. The onet_code is dependent on other values which
relate to the first rule of normalization. This table is the largest in the 
database and depends upon other ones.

Level Scale Anchors

This table is dependent upon the Work Activities table because they connect and
contain values like job_id. The second normal form can't be applied because not 
every attribute is not dependent on onet_code.

Green Occupations 

onet_code connects the table to the work activities table. The first rule of 
normalization still applies because onet_code still can't be connected to all
the tables.

Career Starters Maxtrix

In the Career Starters Maxtrix table, onet_code also connects everything to the 
Work Activities table. The first normal rule still applies.

Alternate Titles 

In the Alternate titles table, onet_code is also used, this is used to connect
all the databases together. The first normal rule applies for the entire 
database.
